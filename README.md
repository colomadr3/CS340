How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writting clean modular coding is difficult but is key to producing  maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. With the CRUD python module, I kept the code simple. Each method was intentional and played a specific role. The dashboard followed the same rules. There were designated sections for specific code and keeping them segregated helped keep it readable. Commenting is also important to keeping code easy to understand. Not only does it help explain what is going on, it also helps to break it up for ease of reading. I enjoyed using python as I was able to do more with less lines of code. This helps keep my programs optimal and easy to understand. Databases are all around us and I can definetly see myself using this code in some form to manipulate data in a database. I may make it a personal project in the future.
    
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

First I need to do a lot of research. It helps that the assignment provided me with all the key points at the start. From there I just needed to figure out how to solve the problem and fuse the answers together. This is important to solving problems as a computer scientist; gathering information. I would usually jump into coding with no clear direction and hope to figure out what I am doing. This is the wrong approach. Now I try to gather as much information as possible to prepare myself so I do not have to spend all my time wading though confusion. To be honest, I didn't my technique to finish the project wasn't much different from the other assignments. I spent a lot of time researching and looking up how to make it work. It is important to know how the data looks. Understanding the attributes of the documents will help to getting what you are looking for.

    
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do a lot. As society grows and technology evolves, we will be on the forefront to meet the needs of the masses. Programing can help and benefit multitudes of people. Even now, people are so relient on technology to accomplish tasks day to day. I look forward to the day when I will be able to assist society with a program I have created.
